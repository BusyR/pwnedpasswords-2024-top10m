Cracking 10 million PwnedPasswords 

--------
Top 10M hashes from the Troy Hunt / haveibeenpwned Pwned Passwords list (version 2024-09-09) with frequency count and cracked plaintext passwords

This list is based on an idea from Royce Williams, who cracked all hashes in the top 20K of the v6 Pwned Passwords list. His list can can be found at https://gist.github.com/roycewilliams/226886fd01572964e1431ac8afc999ce

## Notes and references:
The list actually contains 10.017.103 passwords, as there are 178130 passwords which appear 59 times in the haveibeenpwned Pwned Passwords list. Depending on how you'd sort the hashes, some of these hashes would be included or excluded in the top 10M list, so I decided to just include them all...

Format of the data is:
```
frequency:sha1-hash:plain
```
